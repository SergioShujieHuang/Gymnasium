# CartPole Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project implements reinforcement learning algorithms (Double DQN and A2C) for the `CartPole-v1` environment using Gymnasium and PyTorch. The goal is to train an agent to balance the pole and keep the cart near the center.

## Environment Setup

To ensure all dependencies are properly installed, **please follow both steps below**:

### Step 1: Create Conda environment and install core dependencies

Run the following commands to create and activate the Conda environment with core packages:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate cartpole-dqn
```

### Step 2: Install additional dependencies via pip

After activating the Conda environment, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
